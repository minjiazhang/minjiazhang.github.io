In my leisure time I enjoy both water and winter sports. I find immense joy in skiing, a fun sport that not only thrills me but also allows me to explore various scenic locations, such as <a href="https://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/the-mountain/about-the-mountain/trail-maps.aspx">Whistler and Blackcomb</a>, <a href="https://www.crystalmountainresort.com/">Crystal Mountain</a>, <a href="https://www.deervalley.com/">Deer Valley</a>, <a href="https://www.mtbachelor.com/">Mountain Bachelor</a>, <a href="https://www.winterparkresort.com/">Winter Park</a>. 

I also love swimming. Gliding through the water is both calming and invigorating for me.

Sailing is another interest of mine. It feels both incredibly free to harness the wind to navigate the open water. Every sailing trip is a new adventure, whether it’s a peaceful day on the lake or a challenging journey across the pudget sound.
